- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

### Password Strength Indicator
As you type your password, a strength meter will show:
- **Weak**: Red bar (0-33%)
- **Medium**: Yellow bar (34-66%)
- **Strong**: Green bar (67-100%)

The form validates:

- Admins will be notified when sessions expire
- Proper cleanup of session data on logout

## Technical Details

### Storage Handling
- **With "Remember me"**: Uses localStorage for persistent sessions

- Both storage types are cleared on logout

### JavaScript Functions
