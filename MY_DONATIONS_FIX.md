# My Donations Section Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The "My Donations" section in user profiles was not fetching data from the database for a particular user. After investigation, several issues were identified and fixed:

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. UserDonation Record Creation
**Problem**: UserDonation records were not being consistently linked to users due to ObjectId conversion issues.

**Fix**: Enhanced the donor application route to ensure proper ObjectId conversion when creating UserDonation records.

**File**: `routes/donors.js`
```javascript
// Before
const userDonation = new UserDonation({
    userId: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user.userId),
    // ... other fields
});

// After (with enhanced error handling and logging)
const userObjectId = new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user.userId);
const userDonation = new UserDonation({
    userId: userObjectId,
    // ... other fields
});
```

### 2. UserDonation Model Methods
**Problem**: Static methods in the UserDonation model were not handling string-to-ObjectId conversion properly.

**Fix**: Updated the static methods to ensure proper ObjectId conversion regardless of input type.

**File**: `models/UserDonation.js`
```javascript
// Before
statics.getDonationStats = function(userId) {
    return this.aggregate([
        { $match: { userId: mongoose.Types.ObjectId(userId), isActive: true } },
        // ... aggregation pipeline
    ]);
}

// After
statics.getDonationStats = function(userId) {
    const userObjectId = typeof userId === 'string' ? mongoose.Types.ObjectId(userId) : userId;
    return this.aggregate([
        { $match: { userId: userObjectId, isActive: true } },
        // ... aggregation pipeline
    ]);
}
```

### 3. User Profile Routes
**Problem**: The userProfile routes were not consistently filtering for active donations.

**Fix**: Added `isActive: true` filter to all UserDonation queries in userProfile routes.

**File**: `routes/userProfile.js`
```javascript
// Before
const donations = await UserDonation.find({
    userId: userObjectId
})

// After
const donations = await UserDonation.find({
    userId: userObjectId,
    isActive: true
})
```

## Expected Results

1. When a user submits a donor application while logged in, a UserDonation record will be properly created and linked to their account.
2. The "My Donations" section will now correctly fetch and display donation records for authenticated users.
3. Dashboard statistics will accurately reflect a user's donation history.
4. All queries will properly filter for active donations only.

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Log in as a user
2. Submit a donor application through the donate page
3. Navigate to the profile page and check the "My Donations" section
4. The newly created donation should appear in the list

## Additional Improvements

1. Enhanced logging in the donor application route to help with debugging
2. Added consistent filtering for active records only
3. Improved error handling to prevent failures from breaking the entire request
